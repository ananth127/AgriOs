## 🔄 Debugging Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Discovery ✅ (Current)
- Gathering all information about issues
- Understanding symptoms, history, and context

### Phase 2: Issue Inventory & Categorization
- Creating master issue list
- Categorizing by severity and impact
- Identifying patterns

### Phase 3: Root Cause Hypothesis
- Forming evidence-based hypotheses
- Planning diagnostic experiments

### Phase 4: Systematic Investigation
- Testing hypotheses methodically
- Collecting evidence
- Confirming or eliminating causes

### Phase 5: Root Cause Confirmation
- Verifying findings before fixing
- Understanding full impact scope

### Phase 6: Solution Design
- Planning proper fixes
- Evaluating options
- Designing prevention measures

### Phase 7: Fix Implementation
- Making targeted code changes
- Testing thoroughly
- Documenting fixes

### Phase 8: Post-Fix Explanation
- Knowledge transfer
- Lessons learned
- Best practices documentation
